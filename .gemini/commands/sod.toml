description = "Start of Day - Load session context and operational documentation"

prompt = """
You are starting a new development session.

Execute the Start of Day script to load session context from Crane Context Worker:

!{bash scripts/sod-universal.sh}

The script will:
- Detect the current repository and venture
- Load session context from Crane Context Worker
- Cache operational documentation to /tmp/crane-context/docs/
- Display handoffs from previous sessions
- Show GitHub issues and work queues

After the script completes, you will have:
- Complete operational documentation cached locally
- Session context from previous work
- Visibility into current work priorities
- GitHub issue status across all queues

Use the cached documentation at /tmp/crane-context/docs/ as reference for team workflows, API specs, and project standards throughout this session.
