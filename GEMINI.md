# Gemini CLI Instructions

## Conflict Resolution

When git merge conflicts occur:
1. STOP and show me the conflicted sections
2. Ask which version to keep
3. Edit the file directly to resolve - remove conflict markers, keep the code I specify
4. Do NOT write scripts to reconstruct files

## General Rules

- Ask before taking multi-step destructive actions
- If a simple approach fails twice, stop and ask for guidance
- Don't invent complex workarounds - escalate instead
